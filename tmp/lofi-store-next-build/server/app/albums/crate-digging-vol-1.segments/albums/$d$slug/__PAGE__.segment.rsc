Surrounded by crates of forgotten soul, funk, and R&B records, he developed an encyclopedic knowledge of samples before he could drive. At 16, he started flipping obscure 45s on a beat-up MPC 2000 in the shop's back room. His production style is deceptively simple—find the perfect four-bar loop, add crackle, let it breathe—but his ear for soul is unmatched. Now 32, Dusty has become something of a curator-producer, his tapes serving as both original compositions and guided tours through forgotten corners of Black American music. He still works from the same back room, though he owns the shop now.","shortBio":"LA record shop owner with an encyclopedic ear for forgotten soul samples.","influences":["Madlib","Dilla","Pete Rock","DJ Premier","9th Wonder"],"artStyle":"Vintage photography and collage.
