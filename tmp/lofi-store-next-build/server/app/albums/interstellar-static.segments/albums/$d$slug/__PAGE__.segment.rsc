He moved to Berlin in 2015, drawn by the city's electronic music legacy, and began experimenting with slowing down his synth-heavy compositions, adding lofi warmth to cold digital sounds. The result was something that felt like the future as imagined in the 1980s—chrome and neon, but softened by tape hiss and human imperfection. His music soundtracks imaginary sci-fi films that were never made. Now 38, Klaus produces from a studio filled with vintage synthesizers he's collected from eBay and estate sales, each with its own quirks and character.","shortBio":"Ex-game composer crafting retro-futurist soundscapes from a Berlin synth cave.","influences":["Tangerine Dream","Vangelis","Carpenter Brut","Tycho","Com Truise"],"artStyle":"Retro sci-fi aesthetics.
