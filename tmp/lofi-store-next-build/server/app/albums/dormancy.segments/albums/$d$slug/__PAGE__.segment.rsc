Music became her therapy. Armed with field recording equipment from her research days, she began capturing the sounds of Pacific Northwest forests—rain on fern leaves, creek water over stones, wind through old-growth cedars—and weaving them into meditative beats. Her music is explicitly political: all proceeds fund reforestation projects, and each album is tied to a specific ecosystem she's trying to protect. She produces from a tiny cabin outside Portland, often hiking for hours to capture the perfect sample. Her fanbase spans meditation practitioners, environmental activists, and students seeking focus.","shortBio":"Environmental scientist turned producer.
