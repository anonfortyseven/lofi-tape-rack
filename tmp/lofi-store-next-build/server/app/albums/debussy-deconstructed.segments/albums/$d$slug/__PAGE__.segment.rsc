Struggling with depression, he found that playing piano over hip-hop beats in his dorm room was the only thing that brought relief. His early SoundCloud uploads—just him playing melancholic piano figures over drum breaks—became foundational to the lofi study music movement. Now 34 and a decade into his project, Oliver has become the elder statesman of the genre, known for his technical prowess and emotional depth. He's scored several indie films but always returns to his bedroom productions. He named the project after his habit of watching London rain while composing.","shortBio":"Royal Academy pianist turned lofi pioneer.
