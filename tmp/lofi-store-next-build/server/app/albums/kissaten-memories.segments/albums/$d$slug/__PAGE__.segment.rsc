A classically trained pianist who discovered MPC sampling during a gap year in New York, he returned to Tokyo with a vision: marry the warmth of 70s Japanese jazz with the crunch of golden-era hip-hop drums. His debut tape 'City Rain' caught fire on Japanese YouTube, racking up millions of streams from students pulling all-nighters. Now 28, he produces from a cramped apartment overlooking the Yamanote Line, often recording the train announcements that pepper his tracks. Known for his perfectionist tendencies—he reportedly made 47 versions of his track 'Shibuya Crossing' before release.","shortBio":"Tokyo jazz pianist turned bedroom producer.
