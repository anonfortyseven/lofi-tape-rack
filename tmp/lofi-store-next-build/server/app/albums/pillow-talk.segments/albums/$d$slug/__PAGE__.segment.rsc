She started making music in her tiny Seoul apartment as a form of recovery, layering her soft vocals over gentle beats she produced on her laptop. Her lyrics, sung in both Korean and English, deal with themes of burnout, self-doubt, and finding peace—resonating deeply with her generation. Despite offers from labels, she's remained independent, releasing music on her own schedule ('when it feels right'). Her aesthetic—soft, muted, deliberately low-effort—is a direct rejection of K-pop's polished perfectionism. She's become an icon for young Koreans seeking alternatives to the mainstream.","shortBio":"Ex-K-pop trainee making anti-perfectionist bedroom pop from her Seoul apartment.","influences":["Clairo","beabadoobee","wave to earth","Lauv","Rex Orange County"],"artStyle":"Soft, muted photography with heavy grain.
