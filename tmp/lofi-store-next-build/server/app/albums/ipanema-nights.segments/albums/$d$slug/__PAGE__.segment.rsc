Their father played bossa nova guitar, their mother sang—and every Sunday afternoon was an impromptu jam session with neighborhood musicians. When Lucas discovered beat-making software in college, he immediately knew what he wanted to do: preserve that Sunday afternoon feeling forever. Marina's breathy vocals, sung in Portuguese, anchor tracks that blend their father's João Gilberto records with head-nodding beats. Their music has become synonymous with the 'coffee shop lofi' aesthetic, and they've partnered with numerous Brazilian café chains. They still perform Sunday sessions at their parents' bar.","shortBio":"São Paulo sibling duo keeping bossa nova alive through lofi beats.","influences":["João Gilberto","Tom Jobim","Astrud Gilberto","Toquinho","Marcos Valle"],"artStyle":"Tropical modernism.
