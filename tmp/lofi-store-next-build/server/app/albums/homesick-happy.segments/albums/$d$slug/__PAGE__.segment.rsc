Homesick for the countryside, he started making music that captured the feeling of early mornings on the farm—golden sunlight, acoustic guitar on the porch, the optimism of a new day. His sound is distinctly warmer and more uplifting than most lofi, earning him fans who find the genre too melancholic. A self-taught guitarist, ukulele player, and producer, Liam records most instruments himself in his Fitzroy apartment. His music has been featured in morning show playlists worldwide, and he's become the go-to for 'productive morning' vibes.","shortBio":"Farm boy turned city dweller, making sunrise music for early risers.","influences":["Jack Johnson","Khruangbin","Mac DeMarco","Tash Sultana","Boy Pablo"],"artStyle":"Warm, sun-drenched photography.
