What's known: he started uploading tracks to obscure forums in 2008, years before 'lofi hip hop' was a recognized genre. His production is rooted in the Detroit and New York boom-bap traditions but slowed down, meditative, almost spiritual. Rumored to be a former touring jazz musician, his tracks feature complex chord progressions and sampling choices that suggest serious musical training. He releases music sporadically, sometimes going years between tapes, and communicates only through his music and occasional cryptic social media posts. His anonymity has only added to his legend.","shortBio":"Anonymous Detroit legend.
