Taking refuge in her grandmother's countryside home in Provence, she began making music purely for herself—layering field recordings of lavender fields over dusty vinyl samples from her grandmother's collection of Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg records. What emerged was something entirely new: lofi that felt like half-remembered dreams, like watching French New Wave films through frosted glass. Her music has since been featured in countless 'study with me' videos and has become the soundtrack for European art students and insomniacs alike. She rarely gives interviews and has never performed live, preferring to let her music speak.","shortBio":"Former film composer crafting dreamlike soundscapes from a countryside studio in Provence.","influences":["Erik Satie","Brian Eno","Serge Gainsbourg","Boards of Canada"],"artStyle":"Soft, impressionist watercolors.
