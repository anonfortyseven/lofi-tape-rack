A classically trained pianist who discovered MPC sampling during a gap year in New York, he returned to Tokyo with a vision: marry the warmth of 70s Japanese jazz with the crunch of golden-era hip-hop drums. His debut tape 'City Rain' caught fire on Japanese YouTube, racking up millions of streams from students pulling all-nighters. Now 28, he produces from a cramped apartment overlooking the Yamanote Line, often recording the train announcements that pepper his tracks.

Taking refuge in her grandmother's countryside home in Provence, she began making music purely for herself—layering field recordings of lavender fields over dusty vinyl samples from her grandmother's collection of Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg records. What emerged was something entirely new: lofi that felt like half-remembered dreams, like watching French New Wave films through frosted glass. Her music has since been featured in countless 'study with me' videos and has become the soundtrack for European art students and insomniacs alike.

Surrounded by crates of forgotten soul, funk, and R&B records, he developed an encyclopedic knowledge of samples before he could drive. At 16, he started flipping obscure 45s on a beat-up MPC 2000 in the shop's back room. His production style is deceptively simple—find the perfect four-bar loop, add crackle, let it breathe—but his ear for soul is unmatched. Now 32, Dusty has become something of a curator-producer, his tapes serving as both original compositions and guided tours through forgotten corners of Black American music.

Armed with field recording equipment from her research days, she began capturing the sounds of Pacific Northwest forests—rain on fern leaves, creek water over stones, wind through old-growth cedars—and weaving them into meditative beats. Her music is explicitly political: all proceeds fund reforestation projects, and each album is tied to a specific ecosystem she's trying to protect.

Their father played bossa nova guitar, their mother sang—and every Sunday afternoon was an impromptu jam session with neighborhood musicians. When Lucas discovered beat-making software in college, he immediately knew what he wanted to do: preserve that Sunday afternoon feeling forever. Marina's breathy vocals, sung in Portuguese, anchor tracks that blend their father's João Gilberto records with head-nodding beats.

He moved to Berlin in 2015, drawn by the city's electronic music legacy, and began experimenting with slowing down his synth-heavy compositions, adding lofi warmth to cold digital sounds. The result was something that felt like the future as imagined in the 1980s—chrome and neon, but softened by tape hiss and human imperfection.

Her lyrics, sung in both Korean and English, deal with themes of burnout, self-doubt, and finding peace—resonating deeply with her generation. Despite offers from labels, she's remained independent, releasing music on her own schedule ('when it feels right').

Now 34 and a decade into his project, Oliver has become the elder statesman of the genre, known for his technical prowess and emotional depth.

His sound is distinctly warmer and more uplifting than most lofi, earning him fans who find the genre too melancholic.

Rumored to be a former touring jazz musician, his tracks feature complex chord progressions and sampling choices that suggest serious musical training.
