A classically trained pianist who discovered MPC sampling during a gap year in New York, he returned to Tokyo with a vision: marry the warmth of 70s Japanese jazz with the crunch of golden-era hip-hop drums. His debut tape \'City Rain\' caught fire on Japanese YouTube, racking up millions of streams from students pulling all-nighters. Now 28, he produces from a cramped apartment overlooking the Yamanote Line, often recording the train announcements that pepper his tracks.
